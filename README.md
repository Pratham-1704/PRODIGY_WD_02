To build a stopwatch web application, you can use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML will structure the elements of the stopwatch, such as the display for the elapsed time, buttons for starting, pausing, resetting, and tracking lap times. CSS will be used to style the stopwatch, ensuring that it is visually appealing and responsive across different devices. JavaScript is the core technology that will drive the functionality of the stopwatch. By implementing JavaScript functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the timer, as well as capturing and displaying lap times, the application can accurately measure and record time intervals.

When the user clicks the start button, the stopwatch begins counting in milliseconds, which are then converted into a readable format (minutes, seconds, and milliseconds). The pause button stops the timer without resetting the current time, allowing users to resume timing later. The reset button stops the timer and resets the displayed time to zero. Additionally, a lap button can be added to capture the current time without stopping the stopwatch, storing and displaying it for reference.
